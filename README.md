# Summary

This repo contains my attempts to work through some of the exercises in Purely Functional Data Structures. 
In Rust.

I was hanging out at Virtual RC ([Recurse Center's](www.recurse.com) response to the pandemic), trying to learn Rust, when I got [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a reading group that formed to discuss this book.

I'm pretty sure that combining the two is a bad idea, but as one of my friends quipped, "Bad ideas are good for learning", so here we are.

Feel free to contact me/submit a PR/open an issue if you have suggestions for how to execute this bad idea more elegantly =)
